## Client vs Server State

UI toggles vs API data.

#### Why this matters for `Client vs Server State`

Understanding **Client vs Server State** helps you avoid bugs that are hard to debug later. In interviews, you should be able to explain the idea in one or two sentences and show a minimal code example.

#### Quick recap

- Re-read the code sample above and type it yourself in a Vite React app.
- Change one line at a time and observe what breaks in the browser or terminal.
- Use React DevTools to see how parent and child components connect.

#### Connection to other chapters

This topic builds on earlier JavaScript skills (variables, functions, arrays, async) and connects to later React chapters. Keep a running notes file of patterns you reuse across projects.

## Extended Practice 1 — Data Fetching

Apply one idea from this chapter in isolation:

1. Create `Practice1.jsx` in your Vite `src/` folder.
2. Import it from `App.jsx` and render it.
3. Add a `console.log('render Practice1')` at the top of the component function.
4. Change props or state and watch the console — notice when React re-renders.
5. Open React DevTools → Components and find your practice component.

**Reflection questions:**

- What was the smallest working example you could build?
- What error did you hit first when experimenting?
- How would you explain this topic to someone who only knows JavaScript?

**Stretch goal:** Combine this practice with one concept from the previous chapter and one hook or pattern you already know.
