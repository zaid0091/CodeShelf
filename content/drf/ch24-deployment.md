## Introduction to Deployment

> **Definition:** **Deployment** — a key part of building production-ready APIs with Django REST Framework.



You should already know Django models, views, and URLs. Here we apply those ideas to **Deployment**.

```python
# models.py — example domain for this chapter
from django.db import models

class Book(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=200)
    created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)

    def __str__(self):
        return self.name
```

### Deployment — Mental Model

When learning **Deployment**, think about the **mental model**. In DRF, every request passes through URL routing, authentication, permissions, throttling, parsers, the view, serializers, renderers, and finally the HTTP response. Misunderstanding one layer often looks like a bug in another — always trace the full pipeline.

| Check | Question to ask |
| --- | --- |
| Request | What HTTP method and URL am I using? |
| Auth | Is the user identified (`request.user`)? |
| Permissions | Does this user have rights for this action? |
| Data | Is the JSON body valid for the serializer? |
| Response | Is the status code correct (201 for create, 204 for delete)? |

```bash
# Example read for Deployment
curl -X GET http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/example-1/ \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

### Deployment — Step By Step Flow

When learning **Deployment**, think about the **step-by-step flow**. In DRF, every request passes through URL routing, authentication, permissions, throttling, parsers, the view, serializers, renderers, and finally the HTTP response. Misunderstanding one layer often looks like a bug in another — always trace the full pipeline.

| Check | Question to ask |
| --- | --- |
| Request | What HTTP method and URL am I using? |
| Auth | Is the user identified (`request.user`)? |
| Permissions | Does this user have rights for this action? |
| Data | Is the JSON body valid for the serializer? |
| Response | Is the status code correct (201 for create, 204 for delete)? |

```bash
# Example read for Deployment
curl -X GET http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/example-2/ \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

### Deployment — Comparison Table

When learning **Deployment**, think about the **comparison table**. In DRF, every request passes through URL routing, authentication, permissions, throttling, parsers, the view, serializers, renderers, and finally the HTTP response. Misunderstanding one layer often looks like a bug in another — always trace the full pipeline.

| Check | Question to ask |
| --- | --- |
| Request | What HTTP method and URL am I using? |

| Permissions | Does this user have rights for this action? |
| Data | Is the JSON body valid for the serializer? |
| Response | Is the status code correct (201 for create, 204 for delete)? |

```bash
# Example read for Deployment
curl -X GET http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/example-3/ \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

### Deployment — Production Tip

When learning **Deployment**, think about the **production tip**. In DRF, every request passes through URL routing, authentication, permissions, throttling, parsers, the view, serializers, renderers, and finally the HTTP response. Misunderstanding one layer often looks like a bug in another — always trace the full pipeline.

| Check | Question to ask |

```

### Deployment — Debugging Checklist

When learning **Deployment**, think about the **debugging checklist**. In DRF, every request passes through URL routing, authentication, permissions, throttling, parsers, the view, serializers, renderers, and finally the HTTP response. Misunderstanding one layer often looks like a bug in another — always trace the full pipeline.

| Check | Question to ask |
| --- | --- |
| Request | What HTTP method and URL am I using? |
| Auth | Is the user identified (`request.user`)? |
| Permissions | Does this user have rights for this action? |
| Data | Is the JSON body valid for the serializer? |
| Response | Is the status code correct (201 for create, 204 for delete)? |

```bash
# Example read for Deployment
curl -X GET http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/example-8/ \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

## Step-by-step example

We build a minimal end-to-end flow: model → serializer → view → URL → test with curl.

```python
# serializers.py
from rest_framework import serializers
from .models import Book

class BookSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
    class Meta:
        model = Book
        fields = '__all__'

# views.py
from rest_framework import viewsets
from .models import Book
from .serializers import BookSerializer

class BookViewSet(viewsets.ModelViewSet):
    queryset = Book.objects.all()
    serializer_class = BookSerializer
```
---

## HTTP and curl examples

Test every endpoint from the terminal before wiring the frontend.

```bash
# 
curl -X GET http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/deployment/ \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```



```bash
# 
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/deployment/ \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name":"Example"}'
```



```bash
# 
curl -X GET http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/deployment/1/ \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```



```bash
# 
curl -X PATCH http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/deployment/1/ \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name":"Updated"}'
```



```bash
# 
curl -X DELETE http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/deployment/1/ \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```



---

## Configuration in settings.py

```python
REST_FRAMEWORK = {
    'DEFAULT_PERMISSION_CLASSES': [
        'rest_framework.permissions.IsAuthenticatedOrReadOnly',
    ],
}
```

Tune defaults for **Deployment** in `REST_FRAMEWORK` so you do not repeat settings on every view.

---

## Advanced patterns

Combine **Deployment** with permissions, filtering, and pagination from other chapters.

Override hooks like `get_queryset()`, `perform_create()`, or serializer `validate()` for business rules.

---

## Testing this feature

```python
from rest_framework.test import APITestCase

class BookTests(APITestCase):
    def test_list(self):
        response = self.client.get('/api/deployment/')
        self.assertEqual(response.status_code, 200)
```

## Common Mistakes

### ❌ Skipping Deployment docs

Document behavior in OpenAPI (Chapter 23).

### ❌ Fat views

Keep views thin; put validation in serializers.

### ❌ Wrong HTTP method

Match REST verbs to actions.

### ❌ No authentication on write endpoints

Use `IsAuthenticated` for creates/updates.

### ❌ Returning 200 for everything

Use precise status codes.

## Interview Points

### Q: What is Deployment in DRF?

It is part of the request/response pipeline for Deployment.

### Q: How does it interact with serializers?

Serializers validate and shape data; views orchestrate.

### Q: How do you debug failures?

Check status code, `response.data`, Django logs, and query count.
